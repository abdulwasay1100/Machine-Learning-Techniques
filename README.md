**Evaluating a Learning Algorithm (Polynomial Regression):**

In this assignment I created a machine learning model and I find it fits my training data very well. The goal of creating the model was to be able to predict values for new examples.

I test my model's performance on new data before deploying it which has two parts

Splited my original data set into "Training" and "Test" sets.
Use the training data to fit the parameters of the model
Use the test data to evaluate the model on new data
Develop an error function to evaluate my model.
